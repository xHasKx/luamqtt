# Lua versions

It's tested to work on Debian 9 GNU/Linux with Lua versions:

* Lua 5.1 ... Lua 5.4 (**i.e. any modern Lua version**)
* LuaJIT 2.0.0 ... LuaJIT 2.1.0 beta3
* It may also work on other Lua versions without any guarantees

Also has run under **Windows** and it was ok, but installing luarocks-modules may be a non-trivial task on this OS.
